# Bike-Sharing Service Analysis and Predictor

## Introduction

This repository contains the code and documentation for a class assignment focused on analyzing the bike-sharing service usage in Washington D.C during 2011 and 2012. The assignment aimed to gain insights into bike-sharing usage patterns and develop a predictive model for the total number of bicycle users on an hourly basis.

## Project Highlights

In this assignment, we accomplished the following key tasks:

1. **Data Analysis**:
   - Explored and analyzed the bike-sharing service dataset.
   - Identified usage patterns, trends, and correlations in the data.

2. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - Tested different models to determine the best fit.
   - Developed an XGBoost Regressor model for forecasting the total number of bicycle users hourly.
   - Assessed the model's performance and accuracy.

3. **Interactive App**:
   - Created a Streamlit web application for visualizing and interacting with the data and model.
   - The app can be accessed [here](https://python-project-je7hwgegklgqctegfrx3in.streamlit.app/).
